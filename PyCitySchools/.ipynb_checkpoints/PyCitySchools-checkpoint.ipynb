    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to an intial assumption, schools with higher budgets did not yield better test results. \"Budget per Student\" did not seem to correlate with overall school performance when analyzing \"Average Math Score\", \"Average Reading Score\", \"% Passing Math, \"% Passing Reading\", or \"% Overall Passing\". In most instances, spending per student correlated negatively with these metrics, that is, as spending per student increases, we see lower scores. Schools with higher spending, around 645-675 dollars per student, actually underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets of about $ 585 per student.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only part of the picture, and assuming a correlation there is likely false. For we see that as a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%), passing reading performances (96%-97%\tpassing vs 83%), and overall rates of passing math and reading (90%-91% passing vs 58%). This suggests a strong relationship between school size and student performance metrics. Simply put, smaller schools performed better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, schools scored similar average results per grade when comparing the above metrics over time. Huang High School, for example, had average Math scores from grades 9 through 12 of 77.03%, 75.91%, 76.45%, 77.23%, respectively. All other schools had similar average scores from one grade to the next. Moving from one grade to another, and perhaps switching from one teacher to another, seems to have little effect on average scores within individual schools. This suggests that broader contextual issues such as overall school size have play a larger role than individual classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school. That said, a good starting point for additional analysis would be average class size.\n"
